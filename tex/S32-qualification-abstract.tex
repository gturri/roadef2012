\section{Introduction}

We developped a new metaheuristic to solve the problem of the
ROADEF/EURO challenge.  Basically, it can be viewed as the hybridation
of a branch and bound with a GRASP using Monte Carlo Tree Search.

First, we present the method and its different parts.  Then, we show
the results we have on the given instances. Finally, an overview of
the improvement we will do to the method is exposed.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Monte Carlo Tree Search}

\cite{kocsis2006bandit} proposed to guide the exploration of a tree
using multi-armed bandit technics and Monte Carlo as an evaluation of
a node.  This method is also known as UCT (for Upper Confidence bound
for Tree, the name of the main formula of the method) or MCTS (for
Monte Carlo Tree Search).  Thanks to this method, Mogo, a Go
artificial intelligence, became competitive with humans
\cite{gelly2007contribution}.  Because this method allow to explore a
tree integrating the exploration exploitation problem, we decided to
base our optimisation method on MCTS.

Basically, the method works as follow:
\begin{itemize}
\item UCT choose a node to expand.
\item The node is expanded, and one Monte Carlo simulation is done at
  each new created node. Each Monte Carlo simulation returns an
  evaluation of its node between 0 and 1.
\item The evaluation of the simulation are used to update the
  knowledge of the problem.
\end{itemize}
This sequence is done until the stop condition is meet.

We adapted MCTS to optimization problems. Our main modification is
that we manage solved nodes.  As a consequence, if our method runs
enough time, it will stop with the optimal solution.

This method is composed of different modules:
\begin{itemize}
\item a search tree;
\item a Monte Carlo Simulation system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Search Tree}

process with the most possibilities, and median branching

no lower bound for the moment

\subsection{Monte Carlo Simulation}

random solution close to the given initial solution

\subsection{Local Search}

Simple greedy

\subsection{Technical details}

C++, autotools, boost, Gecode, git

Tested on Linux, Cygwin and OpenBSD, should work on any Unix and maybe
on Windows.

\section{Perspectives}

improvement of the Monte Carlo Simulation using an heuristic to assign
a process to a machine

improvement of the local search (tabu search, simulated annealing, LP,
incremental evaluation)

improvement of the search tree

parallel search

using a lower bound
