\section{Introduction}

We developped a new metaheuristic to solve the problem of the
ROADEF/EURO challenge.  Basically, it can be viewed as the hybridation
of a branch and bound with a GRASP using Monte Carlo Tree Search.

First, we present the method and its different parts.  Then, we show
the results we have on the given instances. Finally, an overview of
the improvement we will do to the method is exposed.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Monte Carlo Tree Search}

\cite{kocsis2006bandit} proposed to guide the exploration of a tree
using multi-armed bandit technics and Monte Carlo as an evaluation of
a node.  This method is also known as UCT (for Upper Confidence bound
for Tree, the name of the main formula of the method) or MCTS (for
Monte Carlo Tree Search).  Thanks to this method, Mogo, a Go
artificial intelligence, became competitive with humans
\cite{gelly2007contribution}.  Because this method allow to explore a
tree integrating the exploration exploitation problem, we decided to
base our optimisation method on MCTS.

Basically, the method works as follow:
\begin{itemize}
\item UCT choose a node to expand.
\item The node is expanded, and one Monte Carlo simulation is done at
  each new created node. Each Monte Carlo simulation returns an
  evaluation of its node between 0 and 1.
\item The evaluation of the simulation are used to update the
  knowledge of the problem.
\end{itemize}
This sequence is done until the stop condition is meet.

We adapted MCTS to optimization problems. Our main modification is
that we manage solved nodes.  As a consequence, if our method runs
enough time, it will stop with the optimal solution.

This method is composed of different modules:
\begin{itemize}
\item a search tree;
\item a Monte Carlo Simulation system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Search Tree}

We use a simple branching scheme: we select the processus with the
most possible machine assignable, and we cut this list in two equal
parts.

\subsection{Monte Carlo Simulation}

The simulation is the core of the method.  According to
\cite{gelly2007contribution}, a good simulation must be random, and
improving the simulation with heuristics improve the results a lot.
Because of that, we choose to first randomly generate a solution, and
then improving it with a local search.

Because generating a purely feasible random solution is very
difficult, we search randomly a feasible solution near the given
initial solution.

On the feasible solution provided by the Monte Carlo method, we launch
a greedy algorithm to improve the solution.  The algorithm try to move
every processus in imprortance order to every possible machine and
select the move if it improve the current solution.

\subsection{Technical details}

Our program use C++ with the STL and the Boost library.  We also use
the autotools to build the project and git to manage the sources.

To manage the constraints, we use Gecode, a C++ constraint programming
library under the MIT license.  Particularly, the Monte Carlo is done
using Gecode search procedures, and the local search use Gecode
filtering.

Finally, our code is licenced under the ISC license, a well known BSD
style license.  So, our program and its dependencies are under BSD
style licences.

\section{Perspectives}

improvement of the Monte Carlo Simulation using an heuristic to assign
a process to a machine

improvement of the local search (tabu search, simulated annealing, LP,
incremental evaluation)

improvement of the search tree

parallel search

using a lower bound

\section{Conclusion}

In this article we presented a new metaheuristic and applied it to a
real world problem.  We improve the solution on every given
instances.  Moreover, we identified a lot of possibilities of
improvement.
