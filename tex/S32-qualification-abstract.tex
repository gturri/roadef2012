\section{Introduction}

We developped a new metaheuristic to solve the problem of the
ROADEF/EURO challenge.  Basically, it can be viewed as the hybridation
of a branch and bound with a GRASP using Monte Carlo Tree Search.

First, we present the method and its different parts.  Then, we show
the results we have on the given instances. Finally, an overview of
the improvement we will do to the method is exposed.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Monte Carlo Tree Search}

presentation

usage in the game of Go

our adaptations to optimisation problems

\subsection{Search Tree}

process with the most possibilities, and median branching

no lower bound for the moment

\subsection{Monte Carlo Simulation}

random solution close to the given initial solution

\subsection{Local Search}

Simple greedy

\subsection{Technical details}

C++, autotools, boost, Gecode, git

Tested on Linux, Cygwin and OpenBSD, should work on any Unix and maybe
on Windows.

\section{Results}



\section{Perspectives}

improvement of the Monte Carlo Simulation using an heuristic to assign
a process to a machine

improvement of the local search (tabu search, simulated annealing, LP)

improvement of the search tree

parallel search

using a lower bound
